# Development Workflow

## Package Management

- Use PNPM as the package manager (specified in [package.json](mdc:package.json))
- Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies
- Use `pnpm start` to start development server
- Use `pnpm build` to create production build

## Code Quality

- Prettier is configured for code formatting
- Run `pnpm prettier:check` to check formatting
- Run `pnpm prettier:fix` to auto-fix formatting issues
- The test script runs prettier checks

## Build Process

- Build output goes to `./dist` directory
- Environment variables are injected during build:
  - `REACT_APP_VERSION` from package.json version
  - `REACT_APP_BUILD_TIME` with current timestamp
- Build path is configured as `./dist`

## Dependency Updates

- Use the Taskfile for automated dependency updates
- Run `task update-dependencies` to:
  - Pull latest changes
  - Update all dependencies
  - Run tests and build
  - Commit changes and create version tag
  - Push to main branch

## Environment Configuration

- Environment variables are managed in [src/constants.ts](mdc:src/constants.ts)
- Production/development environment detection
- Version and build time tracking
